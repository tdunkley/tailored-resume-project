# Revised Action Plan for Resume Section Validation and Word Output

## 1. Section Setup and Testing
- **Input**: Ensure `resume.json` is the single source of truth for all section rules.
- **Step**:
  - Extract section-specific rules from `resume.json`.
  - Review `best_practices.json` to validate global formatting requirements.
- **Output**: Inline previews in the chat for each section’s content.

## 2. Automated Section Validation
- **Objective**: Compare each section’s content against `resume.json` and `best_practices.json` for:
  - Required fields.
  - Formatting rules (font size, capitalization, spacing).
  - Logical field order.
- **Action**: Script automated error-checking for missing fields, improper capitalization, or deviations from best practices.

## 3. Inline Previews for Validation
- **Requirement**: Display an inline visual representation of the section content directly in the chat.
- **Action**:
  - Render **exact text** formatting using the chat’s text capabilities (not HTML).
  - Include notes on missing fields or formatting inconsistencies.

## 4. Word Document Generation
- **Objective**: Generate a Word document for the tested section only **after inline validation**.
- **Steps**:
  - Use `python-docx` for Word output.
  - Test formatting specifically for:
    - Line breaks.
    - Hyperlinks (e.g., LinkedIn URL).
    - Consistent spacing and separators (e.g., pipes `|`).
  - Ensure all required content renders properly without issues in Word.

## 5. Final Validation and User Approval
- **Action**:
  - Provide the Word document for review.
  - Address any remaining formatting or content issues based on feedback.
  - Once approved, save the section-specific `.py` file.

## 6. Handling Environment Constraints
- **Issue**: Avoid losing session-generated files due to environment resets.
- **Solution**:
  - Save finalized Python scripts for each section locally.
  - Encourage local script execution for Word generation when the environment is unstable.

## 7. Workflow for Entire Resume
- **Objective**: Assemble all validated sections into a full resume.
- **Steps**:
  - Merge section-specific Word outputs into a final resume document.
  - Ensure consistency in headers, spacing, and formatting across sections.
  - Final validation and Word document approval.

## Immediate Adjustments from Issues Observed
1. **LinkedIn URL Formatting**:
   - Ensure clickable hyperlinks with consistent pipe separators after the URL.
   - Add robust testing of Word output to verify hyperlink functionality.
2. **Session Stability**:
   - Prioritize Python script saving to avoid recreating logic for each test.
   - Provide alternative local script execution instructions as backup.
3. **User Approval Flow**:
   - Require inline previews before generating Word files.
   - Confirm Word outputs match expectations before moving to the next steps.
