# Action Plan for Testing

The **Action Plan for Testing** is a crucial part of the overall process. It’s the plan for how we will validate and test each section of the resume, ensuring that every detail in the `resume.json` file is correctly applied—such as formatting, content, and business rules.

## Action Plan for Testing

### Goal
The goal of this action plan is to ensure each section of the resume (starting with the `personal_information` section) is validated against the rules defined in the `resume.json` file. The process will be repeated for all other sections until the resume is fully tested.

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Section Preparation
- **Task**: Extract the section from the `resume.json` file (e.g., `personal_information`).
- **Why**: Ensure that the data is properly parsed and available for testing.
- **Action**: Load the section and retrieve both content and formatting rules from the JSON.

---

### Step 2: Format Validation
- **Task**: Apply and verify formatting rules such as uppercase, font size, line spacing, etc.
- **Why**: Ensure that the section content adheres to the formatting requirements in the JSON file.
- **Action**: Perform checks like:
  - Is the name in uppercase? (from JSON)
  - Are the line spacing requirements applied correctly?
  - Is the font size applied properly?

---

### Step 3: Inline Preview Generation
- **Task**: Generate a preview of the section in the chat for visual validation.
- **Why**: This is the step where you will visually validate whether the section formatting is correct.
- **Action**: Display the content, applying the formatting from the JSON rules. You will then approve or reject it.

---

### Step 4: Word File Generation
- **Task**: If the inline preview is approved, generate the corresponding Word file for that section.
- **Why**: This step ensures that once the formatting is validated in the preview, the same formatting can be applied in the final Word file.
- **Action**: Generate the Word document and save it in the `outputs` folder.

---

### Step 5: Git Commit
- **Task**: After validating the section, commit the tested code, including any generated files (inline preview and Word document).
- **Why**: This ensures that your progress is saved, and any changes to the section are tracked in Git. If the environment resets, the changes are preserved.
- **Action**: Run the following Git commands:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Finalize personal_information section with formatting and content"
  git push origin master

---

### Step 6: Repeat for Other Sections
- **Task**: Move on to the next section (e.g., work_experience, skills, etc.) and repeat the process.
- **Why**: This ensures all sections are thoroughly tested, validated, and formatted according to the rules.
- **Action**: Continue through the sections one by one, following the same steps as above.
