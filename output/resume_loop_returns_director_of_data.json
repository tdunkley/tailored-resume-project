Data will be at the core of everything we do and some of our most critical work as we grow. Our future is to create data-based products that use modern techniques for delivering not only data, but also invaluable insights. We'll identify problems our merchants don't even know they have and use our data to create solutions that thrill merchants with their ability to predict and forecast their customer's needs. As the Director of Data , you'll lead a talented team of data professionals to develop and scale data products that provide critical insights for our merchants. You'll set the vision for our data strategy, ensuring collaboration across teams to drive impactful, data-driven decisions at Loop. But the impact you'll have doesn't stop there! By reporting through Product, this will allow you to be part of the Product leadership team and contribute to overall product strategy and vision. Right away, we've listed what we think you'll be spending your time on. We're growing fast, and growth means the challenges we'll work on together will change as we lead Loop through new and different phases. This is an indispensable role with us, so we'll be looking for you to have examples of when you've tackled these challenges throughout your career. We've laid out the experience we think is important to set you up for success in this role. But, we appreciate that different humans will solve problems in different ways, so we don't expect you to fit exactly in a box of requirements. At Loop, we believe that flexibility and choice are what allow you to do your best work. With our Blended Working Environment, you have options ranging from joining our HQ office (in Columbus, Ohio), opting into a Hub (a location with 4+ team members), or staying totally secluded (our version of remote). Our team is spread across the United States, select provinces in Canada (Ontario & British Columbia), and the United Kingdom. Wherever you live, you can create the work environment that best matches your preferences and lifestyle. What You'll Do: Harness the unique power and scale of Loop's data from thousands of merchants (including Shopify's largest and most influential brands) and their customers and transactions to transform Data at Loop from being a supporting and serving function to one that is invaluable to the service of customers and the development of our products. Ensure Loop is set up for success to provide insights and analysis to customers and internal Loop employees while creating unique value and monetization opportunities with data products. To accomplish this, you will create and maintain the overall data roadmap, which balances internal and external stakeholder needs. Set the vision and direction for data strategy and architecture, ensuring that we are planning, building and scaling for the future. Initiate innovative efforts to mature our tools, systems, and processes to accomplish this future. Serve as part of the Product leadership team, reporting to the SVP of Product. You will contribute to the product strategy and vision, ensuring that data is used to make decisions and create unparalleled value. You effectively communicate up, down, and across to ensure executives, stakeholders, peers and your team understand the priorities of the business, the priorities of the data team and how to best deliver against those priorities together. You are a champion and are able to gain the trust and buy-in of cross-functional stakeholders, leaders and your team.
